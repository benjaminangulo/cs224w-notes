As a contribution to the CS224W course notes, I have created notes surrounding the lecture around Message Passing and Node Classification. I sought to incorporate both information from the slides and information from lecture. I believe I have brought this pull-request into a good state, and hope that it may be accepted. However, I am happy to make any additional changes the teaching-staff requires. I tried to strike the right balance between conciseness and detail, but if there are portions that could be better cropped or elaborated, please let me know. I'm sure over time, more students will contribute to these notes as well. Thank you for your time! https://benjaminangulo.github.io/cs224w-notes/ Github is still building it as of now.
